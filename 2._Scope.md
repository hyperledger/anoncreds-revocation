# Scope

This document outlines the scope of work undertaken by the AnonCreds Revocation efforts that are being undertaken by the AnonCreds Open Specification Working Group.

## Objectives

The objective of this effort is to document the privacy and security requirements for an AnonCreds revocation scheme.

## Background/Context

We are looking for a replacement for the [AnonCreds v1.0 Revocation Scheme], known formally as CKS Signatures. The scheme is not sufficiently scalable and privacy preserving for the anticipated "jurisdiction-level" use cases for AnonCreds--one or more credentials for every resident of jurisdiction. In looking for a replacement, we need to define what the requirements are for a sufficiently privacy-preserving and secure scheme.

## Deliverables

1. A formal document listing the privacy and security requirements, desirable features, and practical considerations for a sufficient AnonCreds revocation scheme.
