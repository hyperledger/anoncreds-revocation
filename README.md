# AnonCreds Revocation

![AnonCreds Logo](/spec/images/logo/hl_anoncreds_colour.svg)

This repository contains the requirements for a verifiable credential revocation
scheme suitable for use with AnonCreds. We are looking for a replacement for the
[AnonCreds v1.0 Revocation Scheme], known formally as CKS Signatures. The
existing scheme is not sufficiently scalable and privacy preserving for the
anticipated "jurisdiction-level" use cases for AnonCreds--one or more
credentials for every resident of jurisdiction. In looking for a replacement, we
need to define what the requirements are for a sufficiently privacy-preserving
and secure scheme. The purpose of this repository is to capture and document
those requirements.
