## Introduction

[AnonCreds] must support the revocation of [[ref: Credentials]] issued to [[ref:
Holders]] by [[ref: Issuers]]. The scheme used to support revocation must not
compromise the AnonCreds privacy and security considerations,a nd must be
practical for the expected characteristics of AnonCreds participants: issuers,
holders and verifiers. This document defines the requirements for a suitable AnonCreds revocation
scheme.
